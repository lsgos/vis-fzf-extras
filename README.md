# vis-fzf-extras
there is an existing project [here](https://github.com/guillaumecherel/vis-fzf-open) which uses fzf to open files in vis.
I find this handy, but there are a couple other areas where I find fzf better than the built-in vis-complete script, especially in 
dealing with completing filenames.

Currently, completing filenames (replacing `<C-x><C-f>` with a fzf based version) is the only thing implemented, but if I feel the 
need to add more it will also go here.
